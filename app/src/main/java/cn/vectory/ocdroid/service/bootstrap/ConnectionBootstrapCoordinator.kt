/**
 * Observable TOFU bootstrap state, shared between the foreground
 * [cn.vectory.ocdroid.ui.controller.ConnectionCoordinator] and the background
 * `SessionStreamingService`.
 *
 * States (see [FGS spec §10 / §5][spec]):
 *  - [Idle] — no TOFU prompt outstanding; SSE bootstrap is free to proceed.
 *  - [TrustPending] — an SSL/cert failure was classified as trust-on-first-use
 *    and a capture + prompt are in flight. While pending, the SSE bootstrap is
 *    FROZEN: the connect retry loop SUSPENDS on the
 *    [CompletableDeferred]<[TofuDecision]> installed via [setTofuDecision],
 *    [startSSE][ccStartSse]/[coldStartReconnect][ccCold] early-return, and a
 *    re-entrant [testConnection][ccTest] defers — exactly the three guards the
 *    pre-extraction CC held privately on `pendingTofuHostPort != null`.
 *  - [DegradedNeedsActivity] — FGS spec §5「未决 TOFU 且无 Activity」: a TOFU
 *    prompt is owed but no Activity is available to show the dialog (the
 *    Service is running the bootstrap on a cold / sticky-restart path with no
 *    started Activity). The bootstrap MUST NOT block on a UI deferred that can
 *    never complete and MUST NOT burn the SSE retry budget looping; the
 *    outstanding [CompletableDeferred] is cancelled so the awaiter resumes
 *    cleanly and the [tofuState] surfaces this so a placeholder notification
 *    (with an Open action) can be shown. The notification UI itself is Phase 1;
 *    this coordinator only exposes the state.
 *
 * Thread-safety: `@Singleton` + a private intrinsic lock serialise every
 * mutating op because both CC (main thread) and the Service (its own scope)
 * call into the same instance concurrently. [tofuState] is a
 * [MutableStateFlow] (thread-safe by contract); the pending
 * [CompletableDeferred] reference is guarded by the same lock.
 *
 * Extraction boundary (P0.5): this class ONLY encapsulates the TOFU state CC
 * held privately (`pendingTofuHostPort` / `pendingTofuDecision` /
 * `resolveTofuTrust`) plus the degraded path. The actual re-wiring of CC to
 * delegate here is the switch-over lane; CC is intentionally untouched.
 *
 * [spec]: docs/ocmar/specs/2026-07-13-notification-background-fgs-design.md

 *   §10 (TOFU / bootstrap 抽离).
