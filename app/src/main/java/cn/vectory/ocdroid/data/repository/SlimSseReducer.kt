/**
 * Cluster A (slim SSE reducer): per-session view of the latest known state
 * derived from `session.digest` frames. Stored under
 * [OpenCodeRepository.slimSseState] so the reducer is pure (state in →
 * state out + decision) and unit-testable in isolation.
 *
 * # Task 6 (slimapi v1 §G5) — split watermark
 *
 * The session's "what the server told us" ([remoteMessageId] /
 * [remoteUpdatedAt]) is split from "what we've successfully fetched and
 * applied via REST" ([localAppliedMessageId] / [localAppliedUpdatedAt]).
 * The split is what lets the client distinguish "digest observed but not
 * yet fetched" from "fetched and merged" — the previous single-watermark
 * model conflated the two, which made reconcile decisions ambiguous.
 *
 *  - [remoteUpdatedAt] / [remoteMessageId]: advanced MONOTONICALLY by the
 *    digest reducer ([reduceSlimDigest]) — every digest observation
 *    ratchets these forward (or leaves them on a stale / re-emitted
 *    digest). The reducer NEVER rolls them back.
 *  - [localAppliedUpdatedAt] / [localAppliedMessageId]: advanced ONLY by
 *    [onReconcileSuccess] (pure function in [SlimapiResync]). The digest
 *    reducer NEVER touches these. This is the core invariant — "applied"
 *    means a REST fetch succeeded and the result was merged into the
 *    local message cache.
 *  - [dirty]: ratcheted to `true` by the digest reducer when
 *    [needsReconcile] holds after the merge (the local view is behind the
 *    remote view). Cleared to `false` ONLY by [onReconcileSuccess].
 *    [onReconcileFailure] preserves it. Non-focus digests set `dirty`
 *    but never clear it (T6-C3) — clearing is deferred to the next
 *    reconcile pass.
 *  - [lastError]: three-state merge of the digest's `lastError` field
 *    (T6-C4). [LastErrorField.Omitted] preserves the prior value (debounce
 *    tick that doesn't restate the field); [LastErrorField.Cleared] sets
 *    it to null (sidecar signals upstream recovery); [LastErrorField.Set]
 *    takes the new value (sidecar surfaces an upstream error). The
 *    reducer merges via [mergeLastError] — see T1's [LastErrorField] for
 *    the absent-vs-present-null semantics that make this faithful.
 *  - [archived]: monotonic-max like [remoteUpdatedAt] — it's a permanent
 *    timestamp from `info.time.archived` (deployed contract §3); a stale
 *    digest MUST NOT regress it (§3 debounce + archive permanence).
 *
 * Field semantics mirror [SlimSessionDigest] absent-field handling: a null
 * field means "no information from the last digest" (the sidecar only emits
 * changed fields, §3). The reducer merges present fields onto the prior
 * state; absent fields preserve the prior value.
 *
 * ## Backward-compat accessors (T6 transitional, removed by T11 wiring)
 *
 * The pre-T6 single-watermark callers in `OpenCodeRepository` (slim
 * `/since/` anchor reads at `:911` + `:2062`, post-REST bump at
 * `bumpSlimBookmarkFromItems`) read/wrote a single `updatedAt` /
 * `messageId`. T6 rewrites the storage but T11 owns the call-site rewire
 * (routing post-REST through [onReconcileSuccess] instead of
 * [SlimSseState.bumpUpdatedAt]). Until T11 lands, the accessors below
 * preserve the OLD single-watermark view (`localApplied ?: remote` —
 * prefer the field that actually reflects a successful REST fetch, fall
 * back to the digest-observed value when none has been applied yet) so
 * the slim path keeps compiling + behaving byte-for-byte.

 *   - [SlimSessionState.remoteUpdatedAt] — `max(prior, incoming)` via

 *     digests MUST NOT regress this (invariant #1).
 *   - [SlimSessionState.archived] — monotonic-max (permanent timestamp).
 *   - [SlimSessionState.lastError] — three-state merge via

 *     replaces).
 *   - [SlimSessionState.directory] / [.status] / [.deleted] —
 *     last-write-wins on present fields.
 *
 *  **Does NOT touch (local-applied path):**
 *   - [SlimSessionState.localAppliedMessageId] /
 *     [SlimSessionState.localAppliedUpdatedAt] — advanced ONLY by
 *     [onReconcileSuccess]. The reducer touching these would violate
 *     invariant #2 (the core split: "applied" means REST-succeeded).
 *
 *  **Dirty flag:**
 *   - Set `true` when [needsReconcile] holds against the post-merge
 *     candidate state (local is behind remote). Cleared ONLY by
 *     [onReconcileSuccess]. The reducer NEVER clears `dirty` — clearing
 *     is deferred to a successful REST reconcile (T6-C3: non-focus
 *     digests set `dirty` and don't clear it).
 *
 * ## Fetch decision — TRIGGER vs ANCHOR split (T6-C5 / rev-gpt Critical fix)
 *
 *  Emit [SlimFetchMessages] when the digest's `updatedAt` is strictly
 *  newer than `max(priorRemoteUpdatedAt, priorLocalAppliedUpdatedAt)`
 *  (preserves the OLD single-watermark trigger semantic — the OLD single
 *  `updatedAt` was effectively the max of the two split fields, so this
 *  keeps the debounce against re-emitted / equal / older digests AND the
 *  "don't fire when local has caught up" guarantee).
 *
 *  The `since` anchor — the value the caller passes to
 *  `/slimapi/messages/{sid}/since/{ts}` (server returns
 *  `time.updated >= ts` for messageID-dedup'd boundary inclusion) — is
 *  **`priorLocalAppliedUpdatedAt ?: 0L`**, NOT the max. The anchor is the
 *  REST boundary: it MUST reflect what we've actually applied. Using
 *  `max(remote, local)` here was a Critical consistency bug — when a
 *  prior reconcile failed (`localApplied < remote`, `dirty=true`), a
 *  fresh digest advancing remote further would emit `since=remote` and
 *  SKIP the `(localApplied, remote]` message range that was never
 *  fetched/applied. `remote` only means "what the server told us"; it
 *  carries no claim about what we've merged locally.
 *
 *  - `digest.updatedAt != null` AND
 *    `digest.updatedAt > max(priorRemote, priorLocal)` → fetch with
 *    `since = priorLocalAppliedUpdatedAt ?: 0L`.
 *  - `digest.updatedAt == null` BUT `digest.messageId != null` AND the
 *    messageId is fresh on BOTH watermarks (sidecar emitted a fresh id
 *    without a timestamp — defensive branch covering sidecars that omit
 *    `updatedAt` on pure-status digests) → fetch with the same
 *    local-applied anchor.
 *  - Otherwise → null (no fetch).
 *
 *  Reconcile-failure retry is the wiring's responsibility (T11 reconcile
 *  loop) — the reducer only re-emits fetch when remote ADVANCES, not on
 *  every digest against a stale dirty state.
 *
 * The reducer mutates [state] in place (it is the accumulator). Callers
 * that need a snapshot should call [SlimSseState.all] separately.
 *
 * Pure modulo the [state] mutation (synchronized). No IO, no coroutine
 * launches, no slice reads. Unit-testable as a black box.
