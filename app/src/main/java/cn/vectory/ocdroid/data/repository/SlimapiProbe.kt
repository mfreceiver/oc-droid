/**
 * §slimapi-client-impl-v1 §4 (G3 probeLatestMessageId 收敛): boundary-normalised
 * result of a slim-mode "latest message" probe against the sidecar
 * (`GET /slimapi/messages/{sid}?limit=1&mode=skeleton`).
 *
 * Every probe outcome collapses into exactly one [ProbeResult] shape so the
 * reconcile state machine (T7 pure functions in this same file — added later;
 * T11 resync loop) can pattern-match without touching `retrofit2.Response`
 * or exception types. Bare `probe[0]` access is forbidden downstream — every
 * read site goes through this type.
 *
 * ## Branch table (set by `OpenCodeRepository.probeLatestSlim`)
 *
 * | outcome                       | [ok]  | [empty] | [messageID] | [updatedAt] | [httpStatus] |
 * | ---                          | ---   | ---     | ---         | ---         | ---          |
 * | 200 + empty array            | true  | true    | null        | null        | null         |
 * | 200 + one item               | true  | false   | info.id     | `time.updated ?: time.created` | null |
 * | 200 + null body (defensive)  | false | false   | null        | null        | resp.code()  |
 * | HTTP 4xx/5xx                 | false | false   | null        | null        | resp.code()  |
 * | Network/IO failure           | false | false   | null        | null        | null         |
 *
 * The HTTP-fail vs network-fail split is what lets the reconcile state
 * machine decide between "sid is gone upstream" (`httpStatus == 404` → mark
 * deleted) and "transport is flaky" (`httpStatus == null` → keep dirty,
 * retry next pass).
 *
 * ## Purity
 *
 * Deliberately a plain Kotlin data class with NO `retrofit2.Response` /
 * `okhttp3.*` reference. T7 will add pure helper functions
 * (`needsCatchUp(sessionId, probe)`, etc.) to this same file; keeping the
 * type pure is what makes those helpers unit-testable without a MockWebServer.

// `SlimSessionState`, so they stay unit-testable without constructing

/**
 * §3 `needsCatchUp(probe, localAppliedId, localAppliedTs)` — decides
 * whether the focus/resync loop must pull `GET /slimapi/messages/{sid}`
 * (or `/since/{ts}`) for a session, given a probe result plus the
 * caller's last-applied watermarks.
 *
 * Evaluation order is fixed by §3 (DO NOT reorder):
 *
 * 1. `probe.ok == false` → `false`. The probe failed (HTTP 4xx/5xx or
 *    network/IO). The caller MUST keep this session in `dirty` and
 *    retry next pass; claiming "catch-up needed" here would just mask
 *    a transport failure as "aligned" or trigger a noisy REST storm.
 * 2. `probe.empty` OR `probe.messageID == null` → `false`. Either the
 *    session genuinely has no messages upstream, or the probe returned
 *    a defensive null id — either way there is nothing to catch up to.
 *    (The §3 caller-side "clear local cache if local had messages"
 *    side-effect is intentionally NOT encoded here; this function only
 *    answers the catch-up boolean.)
 * 3. `localAppliedId == null` → `true`. We've never applied any message
 *    for this session locally; the server definitely has more than us.
 * 4. T1 tuple compare: `(probe.updatedAt, probe.messageID)` STRICTLY
 *    greater than `(localAppliedTs, localAppliedId)` in lexicographic
 *    tuple order → `true`. Pre-T1 this was an OR-of-two (`messageID !=
 *    localAppliedId || updatedAt > localAppliedTs`); T1 collapses it
 *    into one [compareWatermark] call — see its kdoc for why the id
 *    tie-break is safe (opencode messageID is lexicographically
 *    strictly monotonic by creation). This also correctly returns
 *    `false` on a STALE probe whose tuple is not strictly greater
 *    (e.g. equal ts + smaller id from an out-of-order re-emit) — no
 *    spurious catch-up.
 * 5. Otherwise → `false`. Aligned; no REST pull needed.
 *
 * Pure: no `suspend`, no IO, no DI, no Android deps.
